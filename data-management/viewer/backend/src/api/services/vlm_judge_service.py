"""Factory for the VLM-as-judge service used by the dataviewer router.

The dataviewer reuses the same :class:`evaluation.vlm_judge.JudgeService`
that the standalone CLI and policy-evaluation pipeline import — there is one
implementation, two consumption surfaces. The service is built lazily on the
