## I Have a Question

Search existing resources before asking:

- Search [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/microsoft/physical-ai-toolchain/issues) for similar questions or problems
- Check [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/microsoft/physical-ai-toolchain/discussions) for community Q&A
- Review the [docs/](docs/) directory for troubleshooting guides

If you cannot find an answer, open a [new discussion](https://github.com/microsoft/physical-ai-toolchain/discussions/new) in the Q&A category. Provide context about what you are trying to accomplish, what you have tried, and any error messages. For bugs or feature requests, use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/microsoft/physical-ai-toolchain/issues/new) instead.

## Development Environment

Run the setup script to configure your local development environment:

```bash
./setup-dev.sh
```

This installs npm dependencies for linting, spell checking, and link validation. See the [Prerequisites](docs/contributing/prerequisites.md) guide for required tools and version requirements.

## Cleanup and Uninstall

Reverse the changes made by `setup-dev.sh` and remove deployed Azure resources.

### Remove Python Environment

The setup script creates a virtual environment at `.venv/` and syncs dependencies from `pyproject.toml`.

```bash
# Deactivate if currently active
command -v deactivate &>/dev/null && deactivate

# Remove the virtual environment
rm -rf .venv
```

### Remove External Dependencies

The setup script clones Isaac Lab for IntelliSense support.

```bash
# Remove Isaac Lab clone
rm -rf external/IsaacLab

# Remove Node.js linting dependencies (if installed separately via npm install)
rm -rf node_modules
```

### Clear Package Caches (Optional)

Free disk space by clearing uv and npm caches. This affects all projects using these tools, not just this repository.

```bash
# Clear uv download and build cache
uv cache clean

# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force
```

### Destroy Azure Infrastructure

Remove all deployed Azure resources:

```bash
cd infrastructure/terraform
terraform destroy -var-file=terraform.tfvars
```

> [!WARNING]
> `terraform destroy` permanently deletes all deployed Azure resources including AKS clusters, storage accounts, Key Vault, and networking. Back up training data and model checkpoints before running this command.

For automation deployments:

```bash
cd infrastructure/terraform/automation
terraform destroy -var-file=terraform.tfvars
```

Verify no orphaned resources remain:

```bash
az group list --query "[?starts_with(name, 'your-prefix')].name" -o tsv
```

See [Cost Considerations](docs/contributing/cost-considerations.md) for component costs and cleanup timing.

## Build and Validation

Run these commands to validate changes before submitting a PR:

```bash
npm run lint:md        # Markdownlint
npm run lint:links     # Markdown link validation
npm run lint:vuln      # OSV-Scanner v2.3.8 dependency vulnerability scan
npm run spell-check    # cspell
npm run test:tf        # Terraform module tests (no Azure credentials required)
```

For Terraform and shell script validation, see the [Prerequisites](docs/contributing/prerequisites.md#build-and-validation-requirements) guide.

### Warning Policy

All CI linters enforce warnings-as-errors. PRs that introduce new warnings will not merge.

| Linter                | Enforcement       | Configuration                                     |
|-----------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Markdown (lint:md)    | Errors block      | .markdownlint-cli2.jsonc                          |
| PowerShell (lint:ps)  | Errors + warnings | scripts/linting/Invoke-PSScriptAnalyzer.ps1       |
| YAML (lint:yaml)      | Errors + warnings | .yamllint.yml                                     |
| Terraform (lint:tf)   | Errors block      | .tflint.hcl                                       |
| Go (lint:go)          | Errors block      | .golangci.yml                                     |
| ShellCheck (lint:sh)  | Warnings + errors | .shellcheckrc                                     |
| Python (lint:py)      | Errors block      | pyproject.toml [tool.ruff]                        |
| uv lock (lint:uvlock) | Drift blocks      | scripts/linting/Invoke-UvLockConsistencyCheck.ps1 |
| Vulns (lint:vuln)     | Errors block      | osv-scanner.toml                                  |
| Link check            | Errors block      | .markdownlint-cli2.jsonc                          |

To suppress a specific warning locally, use the linter's inline suppression syntax. Do not change CI configuration to suppress warnings globally without team discussion.

## Updating External Components

Reused externally-maintained components (Helm charts, container images, Terraform providers, Python packages, GitHub Actions) require periodic updates for security patches and compatibility. Dependabot automates updates for Python, Terraform, and GitHub Actions ecosystems. Helm charts and container images require manual updates.

See the [Updating External Components](docs/contributing/component-updates.md) guide for the full process including component inventory, vetting criteria, and breaking change handling.

## Issue Title Conventions

Use structured titles to maintain consistency and enable automation.

```

## Release Process

This project uses [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) for automated version management. All commits to `main` must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

- `feat:` commits trigger a **minor** version bump
- `fix:` commits trigger a **patch** version bump
- `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:` commits appear in the changelog without a version bump
- Commits with `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer trigger a **major** version bump

After merging to `main`, release-please automatically creates a release PR with updated `CHANGELOG.md` and version bumps. Merging that PR creates a GitHub Release and git tag.

For commit message format details, see [commit-message.instructions.md](.github/instructions/commit-message.instructions.md).

## Release Tag Signing

All release tags are required to be signed. Unsigned release tags are non-compliant with project policy.

This repository uses Sigstore `gitsign` with GitHub OIDC identity for keyless tag signing.

### Configure Signing

```bash
# Install gitsign
# https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/signing/gitsign/

# Configure git for keyless x509 signing
git config --global gpg.format x509
git config --global gpg.x509.program gitsign
git config --global tag.gpgSign true
```

### Create a Signed Release Tag

```bash
git tag -s v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### Verify a Signed Tag

```bash
git fetch --tags
git tag -v v1.0.0
```

GitHub Actions validates signatures for pushed version tags (`v*`). CI gates each `v*` tag with constrained `gitsign verify-tag`, binding the signature to the pinned CI workflow identity rather than accepting any valid Sigstore signature. `git tag -v` confirms cryptographic integrity and the Rekor entry but does not validate the signer identity, so it remains a local diagnostic for maintainers rather than the authoritative gate.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Maintainer GPG key distribution is not required for this repository because release tags are signed using keyless Sigstore identities.

## Deprecation Policy

External interfaces follow a formal deprecation lifecycle before removal. The policy covers shell script arguments, environment variables, Terraform variables and outputs, configuration schemas, and workflow templates.

No external interface is removed without a deprecation notice in a prior release. See the [Deprecation Policy](docs/deprecation-policy.md) for scope, deprecation periods, announcement channels, and migration guidance.

## Testing Requirements

All contributions require appropriate tests. This policy supports code quality and the project's [OpenSSF Best Practices](https://www.bestpractices.dev/) goals.

### Policy

- New features require accompanying unit tests.
- Bug fixes require regression tests that reproduce the fixed behavior.
- Refactoring changes must not reduce test coverage.

### Regression Testing

At least half of all bug fix PRs must include a regression test.

A regression test is required when:

- The bug affected user-facing functionality
- The fix changes control flow
- The bug could reasonably recur

A regression test may be omitted when:

- The bug was in documentation only
- The fix is purely cosmetic (whitespace, formatting)
- A test is technically impractical (requires external services that cannot be mocked)

#### What Counts as a Regression Test

| Test Type                              | Counts as Regression Test             |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Unit test verifying the fix            | Yes                                   |
| Integration test covering the scenario | Yes                                   |
| Manual test documented in PR           | Only if automated test is impractical |
| Informal local verification            | No                                    |

### End-to-End Tests

Optionally run the RL end-to-end suite to capture regressions. This is good practice for changes to submission scripts, workflow templates, MLflow wiring, checkpoint handling, or shared RL training assets. The end-to-end suite validates:

- Azure ML or OSMO job submission and lifecycle transitions
- MLflow metrics and parameter tracking for the completed run
- Checkpoint output upload for Azure ML runs
- Workflow task success for OSMO runs

> [!CAUTION]
> These tests submit real GPU workloads and consume Azure ML, OSMO, Kubernetes, and MLflow resources. They are intentionally excluded from default `pytest` runs and must be invoked explicitly.

Requirements:

| Requirement                | Details                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Azure CLI                  | `az` must be installed and authenticated. The Azure ML CLI extension must also be available.                                                                                                   |
| Azure subscription context | Set `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, or make sure `az account show` resolves to the subscription you want the test to use.                                                                             |
| Azure workspace context    | Set `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP` and `AZUREML_WORKSPACE_NAME`, or make sure `terraform output -json` or `infrastructure/terraform/terraform.tfvars` resolves them.                                   |
| Azure ML compute target    | For Azure ML validation, the compute target must resolve from `AZUREML_COMPUTE` or Terraform naming and its provisioning state must be `Succeeded`.                                            |
| OSMO and Kubernetes access | For OSMO validation, `osmo` and `kubectl` must be installed and authenticated, and the target cluster must expose at least one reachable GPU node. Connect the VPN first for private clusters. |
| MLflow access              | The Azure ML workspace used by the tests must expose a working MLflow tracking URI because both validation paths assert metrics and parameters after the run completes.                        |

Run these commands from the repository root:

Each system under test has its own `tests/e2e/test_e2e_*.py` file.

```bash
# Azure ML RL submission path only
uv run pytest -vv -s -m e2e tests/e2e/test_e2e_aml_rl_training.py

# OSMO RL submission path only
uv run pytest -vv -s -m e2e tests/e2e/test_e2e_osmo_rl_training.py

# Full e2e suite
uv run pytest -vv -s -m e2e tests/e2e/
```

#### Bug Fix PR Requirements

When submitting a bug fix:

1. Link to the issue being fixed
2. Include a regression test, or document why one is omitted
3. Describe what the test verifies

Reviewers verify regression tests are included. Compliance is tracked over time via PR labels (`has-regression-test`, `regression-test-omitted`).

### Running Tests

Tests are split into seven pytest component suites that mirror the CI
`pytest-*` flags (`pytest-training`, `pytest-dm-tools`,
`pytest-data-pipeline`, `pytest-inference`, `pytest-dataviewer`,
`pytest-evaluation`, `pytest-fuzz`). Run a single component locally:

```bash
# Training (training/tests)
uv run pytest training/tests -v

# Data management tools (data-management/tools/tests)
uv run pytest data-management/tools/tests -v

# Data pipeline capture (data-pipeline/capture/tests)
uv run pytest data-pipeline/capture/tests -v

# Fleet deployment inference (fleet-deployment/inference/tests)
uv run pytest fleet-deployment/inference/tests -v

# Dataviewer backend (data-management/viewer/backend, run from that dir)
cd data-management/viewer/backend && uv run pytest -v

# Evaluation (evaluation/, run from that dir)
cd evaluation && uv run pytest -v

# Fuzz / regression (tests/, run from repo root)
uv run pytest tests/ -v
```

Run the four root-discovered suites (`tests`, `training/tests`,
`data-management/tools/tests`, `fleet-deployment/inference/tests`) in one
invocation (uses the `testpaths` configured in root `pyproject.toml`).
Dataviewer backend and evaluation run from their own project directories
(each has its own `pyproject.toml`) and are not picked up by the root
discovery:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

Run a component with coverage reporting, matching the CI invocation:

```bash
uv run pytest training/tests -v \
  --cov=training \
  --cov-report=term-missing \
  --cov-report=xml:logs/coverage-training.xml
```

Substitute the component path and `--cov` target for the pytest component
suite you are validating. Codecov tracks pytest uploads by flag, but only the
named project statuses in `codecov.yml` are top-level project gates;
`pytest-fuzz` is advisory and `terraform` uploads test results only.

### Test Organization

Tests mirror the source directory structure under `tests/`:

| Source Path                    | Test Path                        |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `training/rl/utils/env.py`     | `training/tests/test_env.py`     |
| `training/rl/utils/metrics.py` | `training/tests/test_metrics.py` |
| `training/rl/cli_args.py`      | `tests/unit/test_cli_args.py`    |

### Test Categories

| Marker        | Description                        | Planned CI Behavior           |
|---------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| *(default)*   | Unit tests, fast, no external deps | Always runs                   |
| `slow`        | Tests exceeding 5 seconds          | Runs on main, optional on PRs |
| `integration` | Requires external services         | Runs on main only             |
| `gpu`         | Requires CUDA runtime              | Excluded from standard CI     |

Skip categories selectively (applies to any component suite):

```bash
uv run pytest training/tests -m "not slow and not gpu"
```

### Coverage Targets

Coverage thresholds increase with each milestone:

| Milestone | Minimum Coverage |
|-----------|------------------|
| v0.4.0    | 40%              |
| v0.5.0    | 60%              |
| v0.6.0    | 80%              |

CI enforces coverage on every PR through Codecov. The top-level project gates
are the named `pester`, `pytest-training`, `pytest-dm-tools`,
`pytest-data-pipeline`, `pytest-inference`, `pytest-dataviewer`, and
`pytest-evaluation` statuses, each targeting 80%. The default aggregate
project status and aggregate patch status are disabled; component-level
project and patch statuses still apply through
`component_management.default_rules.statuses`. `pytest-fuzz`, `vitest-*`,
`terraform`, and `go` uploads remain tracked but are not top-level project
gates. Local `uv run pytest` emits an advisory `--cov-fail-under=0` report;
Codecov flag uploads remain authoritative for PR coverage gates.

### Configuration

Pytest is centrally configured in the root `pyproject.toml` under
`[tool.pytest.ini_options]`. The `testpaths` entry enumerates the four
root-discovered component test directories (`tests`, `training/tests`,
`data-management/tools/tests`, `fleet-deployment/inference/tests`) so
`uv run pytest` with no arguments discovers every suite served from the
repository root. The dataviewer backend (`data-management/viewer/backend`),
evaluation (`evaluation/`), and data-pipeline capture
(`data-pipeline/capture`) suites have their own `pyproject.toml` and run
from their respective directories; the matching CI flags
(`pytest-dataviewer`, `pytest-evaluation`, `pytest-data-pipeline`) are
defined per-workflow rather than via root discovery. Default options
applied to every root run include `-m "not e2e"`, `--strict-markers`,
`--strict-config`, a JUnit XML report at `logs/pytest-results.xml`, and
advisory coverage reports (`--cov=training`, `--cov=data-management/tools`,
`--cov=fleet-deployment/inference`, `--cov=tests`,
`--cov-report=xml:logs/coverage-root.xml`, `--cov-fail-under=0`). When
adding tests, place them under one of the configured component directories
(or the matching per-domain project) so they are picked up by both local
runs and the matching CI workflow.

### Shell and Infrastructure Tests

Use [BATS-core](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) for shell script tests, [Pester v5](https://pester.dev/) for PowerShell tests, and the native `terraform test` framework for Terraform modules. When adding tests, include framework-specific details in the README for each area.
