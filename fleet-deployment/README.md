# Fleet Deployment

Deploy trained robot policies to edge fleets via FluxCD GitOps pipelines, image automation, and deployment gating.

## Overview

Fleet Deployment manages the lifecycle of trained models from the container registry to production robot fleets. The domain covers:

- **GitOps delivery** — FluxCD reconciles cluster state from Git-declared manifests
- **Image automation** — Automatic policy updates when new model images are published
- **Deployment gating** — Validation gates that block rollout until safety criteria are met
- **Inference runtime** — On-device serving of trained policies via ROS 2 nodes

## 🚀 Quick Start

Bootstrap FluxCD on a target cluster:

```bash
fleet-deployment/gitops/bootstrap.sh
```

Publish a registered AzureML model as a signed, attested inference image:

```bash
# 1. build + sign
fleet-deployment/setup/build-aml-model-image.sh --model-name <model>

# 2. attach SBOM + OpenVEX attestations (run separately; can be repeated)
fleet-deployment/setup/attest-image.sh \
  --image <acr>.azurecr.io/<model>@sha256:<digest>
```

See [setup/README.md](setup/README.md) for the full workflow, base-image
pinning, and VEX-triage guidance.
