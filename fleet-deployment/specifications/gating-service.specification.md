# Gating Service Specification

Deployment gating service that validates trained models before a policy is rolled out to robots, the
safety gate of the fleet-delivery control plane (T4 — Scale), applied before a policy swaps on a
physical arm. See [tier-model.md](../../docs/design/tier-model.md) for the canonical tier definitions.

## Status

Planned: placeholder for future implementation.

## Components

| Component       | Description                                             |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Gate evaluator  | Runs pre-deployment safety and performance checks       |
| Approval API    | Programmatic gate approval/rejection endpoint           |
| Webhook handler | Receives FluxCD alert notifications and triggers checks |
| Gate criteria   | Configurable thresholds for success rate and latency    |
