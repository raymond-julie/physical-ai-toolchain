# Dataviewer Skill

Launch and interact with the Dataset Analysis Tool — a full-stack application for analyzing and annotating robotic training data from episode-based datasets.

## Prerequisites

| Platform | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| All | Python 3.12+, Node.js 18+, npm, `uv` |

The backend virtual environment and frontend `node_modules` are auto-created on first launch by `start.sh`.

## Launch and Connect Workflow

Follow these steps in order every time the dataviewer is started.

### Step 1 — Start the app

Launch `start.sh` as a background terminal process. The script prints `[OK] Both services are running` and the URLs when both services are healthy.

```bash
cd data-management/viewer && ./start.sh
```

With a custom dataset path:

```bash
cd data-management/viewer && DATA_DIR=/path/to/datasets ./start.sh
```

### Step 2 — Open SimpleBrowser

After confirming both services are running (look for `[OK] Backend is healthy` in terminal output), open the frontend in VS Code's SimpleBrowser using the `open_browser_page` tool:

```text
open_browser_page("http://localhost:5173")
```

SimpleBrowser is the primary visual interface for the user. All Playwright automation operates headlessly in the background — the user sees results in SimpleBrowser.

If a non-default `FRONTEND_PORT` was set, substitute that port instead of `5173`.

### Step 3 — Load the Playwright MCP tools

Playwright runs in **headless mode** so it does not open a separate browser window. All visual feedback goes through SimpleBrowser (Step 2). The Playwright MCP server must be declared in `.vscode/mcp.json` with the `--headless` flag:

```json
// .vscode/mcp.json
{
  "servers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest", "--headless"]
    }
  }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `--headless` flag is required. Without it, Playwright opens a separate Chromium window instead of working invisibly behind SimpleBrowser.

Before issuing any browser actions, always load the Playwright tools with:

```text
tool_search_tool_regex("playwright|browser_snapshot|browser_navigate|browser_click|browser_type")
```

If the search returns no results the MCP server has not started. Ask the user to open the VS Code Command Palette and run **MCP: Start Server** → **playwright**, then retry the search.

### Step 4 — Interact via Playwright MCP

Playwright operates headlessly on the same URL as SimpleBrowser. Both see the same backend state, so API-driven changes (labels, annotations) appear in both.

Once the tools are available, use the following patterns for all UI interaction:

| Action | Playwright MCP Tool | Notes |
|--------|-------------------|-------|
| Capture page state | `browser_snapshot` | Call first before any click/type to orient |
| Navigate to URL | `browser_navigate` | Use to reload or go to a route |
| Click an element | `browser_click` | Target `aside li button` for episodes |
| Type into input | `browser_type` | For search or label inputs |
| Take a screenshot | `browser_take_screenshot` | Use to verify visual state |

Always call `browser_snapshot` first to inspect the current DOM before issuing click or type actions. Reference the selector patterns in the [Frontend UI Structure](#frontend-ui-structure) section below.

## Quick Start

Start the dataviewer with the default dataset path:

```bash
cd data-management/viewer && ./start.sh
```

Start with a custom dataset path:

```bash
cd data-management/viewer && DATA_DIR=/path/to/datasets ./start.sh
```

## Parameters Reference

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `DATA_DIR` | `../../../datasets` (relative to `backend/`) | Directory containing dataset subdirectories |
| `BACKEND_PORT` | `8000` | FastAPI backend port |
| `FRONTEND_PORT` | `5173` | Vite frontend dev server port |
| `HEALTH_TIMEOUT` | `30` | Seconds to wait for backend health check |

### Dataset Path Configuration

The `DATA_DIR` environment variable controls which datasets are visible in the app. Each subdirectory under this path is treated as a separate `dataset_id`.

**Methods to set `DATA_DIR`:**

1. **Environment variable override** (recommended for ad-hoc use):

    ```bash
    DATA_DIR=/path/to/datasets ./start.sh
    ```

2. **Edit `backend/.env`** (persists across restarts):

    ```env
    DATA_DIR=/path/to/datasets
    ```

3. **Export before launch** (session-scoped):

    ```bash
    export DATA_DIR=/path/to/datasets
    cd data-management/viewer && ./start.sh
    ```

When a dataset path is provided, update `backend/.env` so the value persists:

1. Read the current `backend/.env` file.
2. Replace the `DATA_DIR=` line with the new absolute path.
3. Start the app with `./start.sh`.

## Annotation Workflow

Annotation combines API calls for efficiency with Playwright UI interaction for verification. Use the API for bulk operations and the UI for visual review and spot-checking.

### Annotation surfaces

The annotation panel exposes three structured surfaces in addition to free-form labels:

| Surface | Storage | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Labels | `meta/episode_labels.json` | Free-form tag set with shared dataset-level options |
| Episode annotation | `EpisodeAnnotation` JSON | Task completeness, trajectory quality, data quality, anomalies |
| Language instruction | `EpisodeAnnotation.language_instruction` | Optional VLA payload (instruction, source, paraphrases, subtask decomposition) |

### Multi-camera selection

Datasets that record multiple camera streams expose a camera selector in the annotation workspace header. Default selection is `episode.cameras[0]` (or the first key of `videoUrls` when `cameras` is empty). User selections persist for the current episode; switching to an episode that no longer contains the selected camera resets selection back to `cameras[0]`. Both video playback and `/frames/{idx}` thumbnail extraction follow the active camera.

### Language instruction (VLA annotation)

The `LanguageInstructionWidget` writes a structured payload through `PUT /api/datasets/{id}/episodes/{idx}/annotations`:

| Field | Purpose | Bounds |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `instruction` | Primary natural-language task description | 1–1000 chars |
| `source` | Provenance: `human`, `template`, `llm-generated`, `retroactive` | enum |
| `language` | BCP-47 language tag, defaults to `en` | up to 10 chars |
| `paraphrases` | Alternative phrasings for data augmentation | up to 50 entries, 1000 chars each |
| `subtask_instructions` | Ordered subtask decomposition for hierarchical conditioning | up to 100 entries, 1000 chars each |

When a dataset task description is available the widget seeds the instruction with `source = template`; otherwise it creates a blank instruction with `source = human`. The source dropdown allows changing the value at any time.

### Step 1 — Analyze trajectory data

Fetch episode trajectory data from the API to determine labels programmatically:

```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:8000/api/datasets/{dataset_id}/episodes/{idx}" | python3 -c "
import sys, json
d = json.load(sys.stdin)
traj = d['trajectory_data']  # List of frames with joint_positions and timestamps
print(f'Frames: {len(traj)}')
print(f'First joint positions: {traj[0]["joint_positions"][:8]}')
print(f'Last joint positions: {traj[-1]["joint_positions"][:8]}')
"
```

Episode trajectory data is a list of frame dictionaries, each containing:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `timestamp` | float | Time in seconds from episode start |
| `frame` | int | Frame index |
| `joint_positions` | list[float] | Joint positions for all robot joints |

The `meta` field of the episode response contains `index`, `length`, `task_index`, and `has_annotations`.

### Step 2 — Determine labels from trajectory

Analyze gripper and joint data at multiple time points to classify episodes. Check the midpoint first, then 25% and 75% for episodes where grasp actions happen earlier or later:

```python
# Example: check grip values at multiple points for robust classification
for pct in [25, 50, 75]:
    idx = int(len(traj) * pct / 100)
    jp = traj[idx]['joint_positions']
    right_grip = jp[7]   # Right arm gripper index
    left_grip = jp[15]   # Left arm gripper index
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some episodes have late or early grasp actions, so checking only the midpoint may yield UNKNOWN results. Always check multiple time points (25%, 50%, 75%) and the minimum grip value across the full trajectory for robust classification.

### Step 3 — Apply labels via API

Use the PUT endpoint for each episode:

```bash
curl -s -X PUT "http://localhost:8000/api/datasets/{dataset_id}/episodes/{idx}/labels" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"labels": ["RIGHT", "SUCCESS"]}'
```

For bulk annotation, loop over episodes in a script:

```python
import json, urllib.request

def annotate(dataset_id, episode_idx, labels):
    data = json.dumps({"labels": labels}).encode()
    req = urllib.request.Request(
        f"http://localhost:8000/api/datasets/{dataset_id}/episodes/{episode_idx}/labels",
        data=data, method="PUT",
        headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"})
    return json.loads(urllib.request.urlopen(req).read())
```

### Step 4 — Persist labels

After applying labels via the API, persist them to disk:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/datasets/{dataset_id}/labels/save"
```

> [!WARNING]
> Labels applied via PUT are held in memory until saved. Always call the save endpoint after bulk annotation to avoid data loss.

#### Label storage on disk

The save endpoint writes labels to a JSON file inside the dataset's `meta/` directory:

```text
{DATA_DIR}/{dataset_id}/meta/episode_labels.json
```

For example, with the default dataset path:

```text
datasets/ur10e_episodes/meta/episode_labels.json
```

File structure:

```json
{
  "dataset_id": "ur10e_episodes",
  "available_labels": ["SUCCESS", "FAILURE", "PARTIAL", "LEFT", "RIGHT"],
  "episodes": {
    "0": ["LEFT", "SUCCESS"],
    "1": ["RIGHT", "SUCCESS"]
  }
}
```

To clear all labels for a fresh start, overwrite the file with an empty `episodes` object:

```json
{
  "dataset_id": "{dataset_id}",
  "available_labels": ["SUCCESS", "FAILURE", "PARTIAL", "LEFT", "RIGHT"],
  "episodes": {}
}
```

After editing the file on disk, restart the backend or reload the page for changes to take effect.

### Step 5 — Verify in UI with Playwright

After applying labels via API, refresh the browser and verify using Playwright:

1. Navigate to the app: `browser_navigate` to `http://localhost:5173`.
2. Wait for episode list to load: `browser_wait_for` with text like `"64 Episodes"`.
3. Take a screenshot to confirm labels appear in the sidebar.
4. Use label filter buttons in the sidebar to verify counts match expectations.
5. Click individual episodes and scroll to the "Episode Labels" section to verify correct labels are applied.

### Step 6 — Interactive annotation via UI

For individual episode review or correction:

1. Click an episode in the sidebar (`aside li button` elements).
2. Scroll to the "Edit Tools" / "Episode Labels" section using `browser_evaluate` with `scrollIntoView`.
3. Toggle label buttons (SUCCESS, FAILURE, PARTIAL, or custom labels) — clicking a selected label removes it.
4. Click "Save All" to persist.

## Frontend UI Structure

The React app has these key areas for Playwright interaction:

| Area | Selector Pattern | Description |
|------|-----------------|-------------|
| Header | `header` | Contains title and dataset selector dropdown |
| Dataset selector | `header select` or `header input` | Dropdown (multi-dataset) or text input (single) |
| Episode sidebar | `aside` | Scrollable episode list with selection state |
| Episode item | `aside li button` | Clickable episode entry with index and metadata |
| Main workspace | `main` | Annotation workspace with frame viewer |
| Label filter | Label filter component in sidebar | Filter episodes by annotation labels |

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Backend fails to start | Check `backend/.venv` exists; run `cd backend && uv venv --python 3.12 && source .venv/bin/activate && uv pip install -e ".[dev,analysis,export]"` |
| Frontend shows "Loading..." indefinitely | Verify backend is healthy: `curl http://localhost:8000/health` |
| No datasets visible | Check `DATA_DIR` in `backend/.env` points to a directory with dataset subdirectories |
| Port conflict | Set `BACKEND_PORT` or `FRONTEND_PORT` environment variables |
| CORS errors | Backend allows localhost ports 5173-5177; check the frontend port is in range |
| Labels not persisted after restart | Call `POST /api/datasets/{id}/labels/save` after API-based annotation |
| Playwright opens separate Chrome window | Ensure `--headless` is in the Playwright MCP args in `.vscode/mcp.json`; restart the MCP server after changing |
| Snapshot refs stale after navigation | Always take a fresh `browser_snapshot` before clicking; refs change on page updates |
| Slider not responding to Playwright | Use `browser_evaluate` with native input value setter and dispatch `input` + `change` events |
| Sidebar not scrolling | Scroll the `aside ul` element directly via `browser_evaluate` with `element.scrollTop = N` |

## VLM-as-Judge Workflow

The VLM judge scores each episode with an outcome MCQ (success/fail with N-sample self-consistency), a GVL process reward (per-frame 0-100 progress + Spearman VOC), milestone decomposition, and failure-mode attribution. Both the dataviewer UI and the CLI under `evaluation/vlm_judge/` consume the same `JudgeService`, so cache hits and prompt versions stay aligned across surfaces.

### Enable the judge

Edit `data-management/viewer/backend/.env` before launch:

```env
DATA_DIR=/abs/path/to/datasets
DATAVIEWER_AUTH_DISABLED=true

VLM_JUDGE_ENABLED=true
VLM_JUDGE_BACKEND=echo                        # echo | qwen3-vl | openai-compat
VLM_JUDGE_MODEL_ID=Qwen/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct
VLM_JUDGE_N_FRAMES=12
VLM_JUDGE_CACHE_DIR=outputs/vlm-judge/cache
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Restart the backend after editing `.env`. Uvicorn `--reload` re-reads code, not env vars. The frontend auto-detects backend state via `GET /api/datasets/{id}/episodes/{idx}/judge`.

### Backends at a glance

| Backend | Use case | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| `echo` | UI smoke / wiring tests | Deterministic stub, no GPU, no network |
| `qwen3-vl` | Local HF inference | First call downloads weights; ~10 GB GPU for `Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct` BF16 |
| `openai-compat` | vLLM / NVIDIA NIM / Azure OpenAI | Set `VLM_JUDGE_BASE_URL` (+ `VLM_JUDGE_API_KEY` if needed); identical code path |

### UI workflow (Trajectory tab)

1. Open the dataviewer (`open_browser_page("http://localhost:5173")`).
2. Pick a dataset, select an episode, switch to the **Trajectory** tab.
3. The **VLM Judge** panel sits between **Episode Labels** and **Language Instructions**.
4. Click **Run judge** → outcome badge, progress sparkline, VOC, optional milestones + failure mode appear. The result also lands on disk under `VLM_JUDGE_CACHE_DIR`.
5. Re-visiting the same episode shows a `cached` badge. Click **Force fresh** to bypass the cache and re-run.

### Playwright UI verification

Use the same MCP tooling as the rest of the skill, but route through the new panel selectors. After a `browser_snapshot`, click using element refs from the snapshot. As a JS-fallback when the snapshot lacks button refs:

```javascript
browser_evaluate: () => {
  const headers = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('h3'))
  const judge = headers.find((el) => el.textContent?.includes('VLM Judge'))
  judge?.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'center' })
  const run = Array.from(judge?.parentElement?.querySelectorAll('button') ?? [])
    .find((b) => /run judge|re-evaluate/i.test(b.textContent ?? ''))
  run?.click()
  return run ? 'clicked' : 'panel not visible'
}
```

To assert the result rendered, wait for the outcome badge text:

```text
browser_wait_for(text="SUCCESS")  # or "FAILURE", "Inconclusive"
```

### Direct API calls (curl / Python)

CSRF must be honored on POST. The frontend hook does this transparently; for ad-hoc shell:

```bash
CSRF=$(curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/csrf-token -c /tmp/dv-cookie | jq -r .csrf_token)

# Cache lookup (no inference)
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/datasets/leisaac-pick-orange/episodes/0/judge | jq

# Run the judge (cache-first)
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/datasets/leisaac-pick-orange/episodes/0/judge \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-CSRF-Token: $CSRF" -b /tmp/dv-cookie \
  -d '{"force": false}' | jq
```

### Bulk evaluation via the CLI (no dataviewer needed)

```bash
# Single dataset
evaluation/vlm_judge/scripts/evaluate-leisaac-pick-orange.sh --limit 5

# Generic
python -m evaluation.vlm_judge.run \
  --dataset datasets/cnc_lerobot \
  --views observation.images.color \
  --backend qwen3-vl \
  --model-id Qwen/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct \
  --output outputs/vlm-judge/cnc_lerobot.jsonl \
  --limit 5

# Policy-rollout MP4s (e.g. leisaac-tests/pickup-orange/)
evaluation/vlm_judge/scripts/evaluate-policy-rollouts.sh
```

The CLI writes a JSONL with the same composite schema as the API, keyed on the same SHA256 cache, so a CLI run primes the dataviewer's cache (and vice versa).
