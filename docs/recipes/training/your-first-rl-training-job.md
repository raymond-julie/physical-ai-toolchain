# Your First RL Training Job

Submit an Isaac Lab RL training job to OSMO and verify that training metrics appear in MLflow. By the end of this recipe, you will have a trained checkpoint for the Anymal-C velocity locomotion task.

> [!NOTE]
> This recipe requires deployed infrastructure with OSMO running. Complete the [Quickstart](../../getting-started/quickstart.md) first.

## 📋 Prerequisites

| Requirement    | Details                                                                      |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Infrastructure | Azure resources deployed via Terraform                                       |
| OSMO           | Control plane and backend running (`kubectl get pods -n osmo-control-plane`) |
| VPN            | Connected to private cluster (if using private AKS)                          |
| Azure CLI      | Authenticated (`az login`)                                                   |
| kubectl        | Connected to AKS cluster                                                     |

## 🚀 Steps

### Step 1: Preview the training configuration

The submission script auto-detects Azure context from Terraform outputs. Preview what will be submitted before running a real job:

```bash
cd training/rl/scripts
./submit-osmo-training.sh --config-preview
```

Review the output. The preview shows the workflow template, task name, container image, GPU/CPU/memory allocation, and Azure ML context. No job is submitted.

### Step 2: Run a smoke test (optional)

Verify Azure connectivity and credential resolution before committing GPU time:

```bash
./submit-osmo-training.sh \
  --task Isaac-Velocity-Rough-Anymal-C-v0 \
  --num-envs 16 \
  --max-iterations 10 \
  --run-smoke-test
```

The smoke test validates Azure ML workspace access, MLflow tracking URI resolution, and storage connectivity. It runs a minimal training loop (10 iterations, 16 environments) to catch configuration issues early.

### Step 3: Submit a training job

Submit a full training run with the SKRL backend (default):

```bash
./submit-osmo-training.sh \
  --task Isaac-Velocity-Rough-Anymal-C-v0 \
  --num-envs 2048 \
  --max-iterations 1500
```

The script packages `training/rl/`, uploads it to OSMO object storage with `osmo data upload`, and injects it into the workflow pod through a `url:` task input. OSMO schedules the job on a GPU node via KAI Scheduler.

Override the backend to use RSL-RL instead of SKRL:

```bash
./submit-osmo-training.sh \
  --task Isaac-Velocity-Rough-Anymal-C-v0 \
  --backend rsl_rl \
  --num-envs 2048 \
  --max-iterations 1500
```

### Step 4: Monitor training progress

**OSMO UI**: Open the OSMO dashboard to view workflow status, pod logs, and real-time metrics. See [Accessing OSMO](../../training/osmo-training.md#-accessing-osmo) for connection instructions (VPN or port-forward).

**Azure ML Studio**: Navigate to your workspace at [ml.azure.com](https://ml.azure.com/), open the Jobs section, and select the MLflow experiment. Training metrics (reward, episode length, loss) stream in real time as the job progresses.

**CLI** (optional): Check workflow status via the OSMO CLI:

```bash
osmo workflow list
```

### Step 5: Verify results in MLflow

1. Open [ml.azure.com](https://ml.azure.com/) and select your workspace
2. Navigate to **Jobs** in the left sidebar
3. Find your experiment (named after the task, e.g., `isaaclab-training`) and select it
4. Click the latest run to open the run detail page
5. Select the **Metrics** tab to view training curves (reward, episode length, loss) — use the chart controls to overlay multiple metrics or smooth noisy curves
6. Select the **Outputs + logs** tab to view stdout/stderr logs from the training container
7. If `--register-checkpoint` was used, navigate to **Models** in the left sidebar to confirm the registered model and its version

List registered models from the CLI:

```bash
az ml model list \
  --resource-group <your-resource-group> \
  --workspace-name <your-workspace>
```

## ✅ Verify

The recipe succeeded when:

- OSMO pod reached `Completed` status
- MLflow experiment shows training metrics across iterations
- A checkpoint artifact exists in the Azure ML model registry (if `--register-checkpoint` was used)
