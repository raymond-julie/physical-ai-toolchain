STRIDE-based threat analysis of the Physical AI Toolchain covering infrastructure-as-code components, trust boundaries, and a prioritized remediation roadmap.

## Executive Summary

This threat model applies the STRIDE framework to the Physical AI Toolchain. The architecture deploys AKS clusters with GPU node pools, Azure Machine Learning, and NVIDIA OSMO for robotics training and inference workloads. All components are infrastructure-as-code artifacts; no hosted service or user-facing application exists.

## System Description

### Architecture Components

| Category       | Component                      | Details                                                              |
|----------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Compute        | AKS Cluster                    | Private cluster, CNI networking, GPU node pools (Standard_NC-series) |
| Data & Storage | Azure Storage Account          | Blob containers for datasets, checkpoints; private endpoint access   |
| Data & Storage | Azure Database for PostgreSQL  | Flexible server for OSMO metadata; VNet-integrated                   |
| Data & Storage | Azure Cache for Redis          | Enterprise tier; OSMO session state; private endpoint                |
| ML & AI        | Azure Machine Learning         | Workspace with managed endpoints; K8s compute attach                 |
| Identity       | Entra ID + Managed Identities  | System-assigned for AKS, user-assigned for workloads                 |
| Networking     | VNet + NSG + NAT Gateway + VPN | Hub-spoke implied; P2S VPN for operator access                       |
| Observability  | Azure Monitor + Log Analytics  | Container Insights, Prometheus metrics, AMPLS for private ingestion  |
| Security       | Azure Key Vault                | RBAC-mode; CSI Secret Store driver syncs secrets to pods             |
| NVIDIA/OSMO    | OSMO Control Plane + Backend   | Orchestrates distributed training; Envoy proxy optional              |

### Data Flows

Training data flows from Azure Blob Storage through AKS pods to GPU compute. Checkpoints and metrics flow back to storage and MLflow tracking. OSMO coordinates multi-node training via its control plane and PostgreSQL metadata store. All Azure service traffic uses private endpoints — no data traverses the public internet.

Operator access traverses a P2S VPN gateway to the AKS API server private endpoint. CI/CD pipelines authenticate via GitHub OIDC federation to Entra ID managed identities. Terraform state resides locally on the operator workstation (see T-2 for associated risk).

### Security Inheritance

| Control                  | Provider             | Configuration Surface           |
|--------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|
| TLS termination          | Azure platform       | Enforced by default             |
| Disk encryption at rest  | Azure platform       | Platform-managed keys (PMK)     |
| Identity federation      | Entra ID             | Workload identity via OIDC      |
| Network segmentation     | Azure VNet + NSG     | Subnets, private endpoints      |
| Secret rotation          | Azure Key Vault      | Deployer responsibility         |
| Cluster patch management | AKS managed upgrades | Deployer selects upgrade policy |

## Trust Boundaries

| ID   | Boundary                         | Description                                                       |
|------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TB-1 | Azure Control Plane ↔ Data Plane | ARM API calls cross into subscription data plane                  |
| TB-2 | VNet Perimeter ↔ Internet        | NAT Gateway egress; VPN ingress; no public endpoints              |
| TB-3 | AKS ↔ Azure Services             | Pod-to-service traffic via private endpoints and managed identity |
| TB-4 | K8s Namespace Isolation          | OSMO, training, inference workloads in separate namespaces        |
| TB-5 | Operator Workstation ↔ Cluster   | P2S VPN tunnel; `kubectl` via private API server                  |
| TB-6 | CI/CD ↔ Repository               | GitHub Actions with OIDC federation; SHA-pinned actions           |
| TB-7 | OSMO Control Plane ↔ Backend     | gRPC between control plane and backend pods                       |
| TB-8 | Training Code ↔ Azure Services   | Python SDK calls via `DefaultAzureCredential`                     |

### Credential Delegation Model

Entra ID issues tokens to managed identities. AKS workload identity federation projects service account tokens to pods. Pods exchange projected tokens for Azure resource access. Key Vault stores secrets and syncs them to Kubernetes Secrets via the CSI driver. The chain: Entra ID → Managed Identities → Workload Identity Federation → Key Vault → K8s Secrets.
