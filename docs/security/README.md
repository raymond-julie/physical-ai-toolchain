## 📋 Overview

Security documentation for the Physical AI Toolchain covering threat analysis, deployment hardening, and vulnerability reporting.

## 🔒 Security Posture

This reference architecture deploys AKS clusters with GPU node pools, Azure Machine Learning, and NVIDIA OSMO for robotics training and inference. All components are infrastructure-as-code artifacts; no hosted service or user-facing application exists.

The [threat model](threat-model.md) documents:

- 19 threats across STRIDE categories
- Security controls mapped to each threat
- Trust boundary analysis across IaC, cluster, and ML pipeline layers
- Prioritized remediation roadmap

The [security guide](../operations/security-guide.md) documents:

- Default security configurations shipped with the architecture
- Deployment team responsibilities before, during, and after provisioning
- Security considerations checklist with Azure documentation references

## 🛠️ Operational Scripts

Automated security and freshness checks that run on GitHub Actions schedules and publish findings to the Security tab.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`scripts/security/Test-BinaryFreshness.ps1`](https://github.com/microsoft/physical-ai-toolchain/blob/main/scripts/security/Test-BinaryFreshness.ps1)     | `check-binary-integrity.yml`   | Verify pinned binary SHA-256 hashes and detect Helm chart version drift (SARIF output)                                                           |
| [`scripts/security/Test-DependencyPinning.ps1`](https://github.com/microsoft/physical-ai-toolchain/blob/main/scripts/security/Test-DependencyPinning.ps1) | `dependency-pinning-scan.yml`  | Validate that GitHub Actions, Docker images, package manifests, and inline pip/uv installs in workflow YAML and shell scripts pin exact versions |
| [`scripts/security/Test-SHAStaleness.ps1`](https://github.com/microsoft/physical-ai-toolchain/blob/main/scripts/security/Test-SHAStaleness.ps1)           | `sha-staleness-check.yml`      | Detect SHA pins that have drifted behind upstream release tags                                                                                   |
| [`scripts/update-chart-hashes.sh`](https://github.com/microsoft/physical-ai-toolchain/blob/main/scripts/update-chart-hashes.sh)                           | Run manually after chart bumps | Refresh pinned Helm chart versions and SHA-256 hashes in `infrastructure/setup/defaults.conf`                                                    |

Each PowerShell script supports a `-SarifFile` parameter for CI integration and a `-ConfigPreview` switch for local dry-run inspection. Run `scripts/update-chart-hashes.sh` locally whenever a pinned Helm chart version is updated so `defaults.conf` stays in sync.

`Test-DependencyPinning.ps1` also flags unpinned inline `pip install` / `uv pip install` commands embedded in workflow YAML and shell scripts, scanned under the `shell-inline-pip` type. A compliant install uses an exact `==` pin, a lockfile (`-r`/`--requirement`, or a `uv export | uv pip install` pipe), or an editable local project (`-e .`). To exempt an intentional non-pin, add a `# pinning-ignore` comment on the install line:

```bash
uv pip install "numpy>=1.26,<2.0"  # pinning-ignore
```
