## 📋 Overview

All GitHub Actions workflows in this repository follow the [OpenSSF Scorecard Token-Permissions](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#token-permissions) principle:

- Top-level `permissions:` is `contents: read` (read-only by default).
- Write-scoped permissions are declared at the **job level** only when a specific step requires them.
- No workflow grants `permissions: write-all` or omits an explicit top-level `permissions:` block.

This document enumerates every job-scoped `security-events`, `contents`, and `attestations` write grant across `.github/workflows/` and records the justification so security auditors and Scorecard reviewers can verify each exception.

## 🔒 Job-Scoped Write Permissions

The 21 write permissions below are required by the action or CLI invoked in the corresponding job. Each grant is the minimum scope needed.

## 🛡️ Defense in Depth

The release-publishing path uses additional hardening beyond minimum permissions:

- All actions are SHA-pinned (no floating tags).
- `persist-credentials: false` on every `actions/checkout` invocation.
- `id-token: write` is granted only to jobs that mint Sigstore OIDC tokens; the token is never exposed to user-controlled steps.
- Release-gated jobs (`generate-dependency-sbom`, `attest-release`, `sbom-diff`, `append-verification-notes`) run only when `release-please` produces a release (`needs.release-please.outputs.release_created == 'true'`).
