Verify the provenance and integrity of release artifacts published by this repository. Each release includes cryptographic attestations generated through GitHub Actions using Sigstore keyless signing, providing tamper-evident proof that artifacts were built from this repository's source code.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Minimum Version | Purpose                                           |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| GitHub CLI  | 2.49.0+         | `gh attestation verify` subcommand for validation |

Install or update GitHub CLI: <https://cli.github.com/>

## Verify Release Artifacts

Download the release artifact from the GitHub Releases page, then verify its provenance attestation:

```bash
gh attestation verify source-v1.2.3.tar.gz \
  --repo microsoft/physical-ai-toolchain
```

Replace `source-v1.2.3.tar.gz` with the actual release artifact filename.

To verify the SBOM attestation specifically:

```bash
gh attestation verify source-v1.2.3.tar.gz \
  --repo microsoft/physical-ai-toolchain \
  --predicate-type https://spdx.dev/Document
```

## What Verification Confirms

Successful verification proves three properties:

- The Sigstore certificate identity is bound to this repository's GitHub Actions workflow, confirming the artifact was produced by an authorized CI/CD pipeline
- A Rekor transparency log entry exists for the signing event, providing an immutable, publicly auditable record
- The artifact digest matches the signed attestation, confirming the file has not been modified since signing

## Inspect the SBOM

Each release includes an SPDX SBOM attestation. Download and inspect the SBOM contents using the GitHub CLI and `jq`:

```bash
gh attestation verify source-v1.2.3.tar.gz \
  --repo microsoft/physical-ai-toolchain \
  --predicate-type https://spdx.dev/Document \
  --format json | jq '.verificationResult.statement.predicate'
```

The SBOM follows the SPDX 2.3 specification and lists all package dependencies included in the release artifact.
