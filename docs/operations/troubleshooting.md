Find the symptom you are experiencing, then follow the resolution steps. Start with the quick diagnostics checklist to narrow down the failure category.

## Quick Diagnostics Checklist

| Check              | Command                                        | Expected           |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Cluster reachable  | `kubectl get nodes`                            | Node list returned |
| GPU available      | `kubectl describe node \| grep nvidia.com/gpu` | GPU count > 0      |
| AzureML extension  | `kubectl get pods -n azureml`                  | All pods Running   |
| OSMO control plane | `kubectl get pods -n osmo-control-plane`       | All pods Running   |
| VPN connected      | `ping <private-endpoint-ip>`                   | Response received  |

## Connection Errors

### kubectl commands hang or return "Unable to connect to the server"

**Cause:** The default deployment creates a private AKS cluster. The API server is not reachable without an active VPN connection.

**Resolution:**

1. Verify VPN connection status in the Azure portal under the VPN Gateway resource.
2. Reconnect using the VPN client profile downloaded during [VPN setup](../infrastructure/vpn.md).
3. Confirm connectivity with `kubectl get nodes`.

### DNS resolution fails for private endpoints

**Cause:** Private DNS zones are not linked to the VPN virtual network, or the client DNS resolver is not forwarding to Azure DNS.

**Resolution:**

1. Verify the private DNS zone link exists: `az network private-dns link vnet list --zone-name <zone> -g <rg>`.
2. On the client machine, flush DNS cache and retry.
3. For persistent failures, add manual host entries from the private endpoint IP addresses.

### kubectl returns "Unauthorized" or "Forbidden"

**Cause:** Azure RBAC role assignment is missing or the kubeconfig token has expired.

**Resolution:**

1. Refresh credentials: `az aks get-credentials --resource-group <rg> --name <cluster> --overwrite-existing`.
2. Verify your Azure AD identity has `Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster User Role` on the cluster resource.

### OSMO UI not reachable at expected URL

**Cause:** DNS zone for the OSMO service URL is not configured, or the ingress controller internal load balancer has no IP assigned.

**Resolution:**

1. Check the ingress service IP: `kubectl get svc -n osmo-control-plane`.
2. Verify DNS records in the private DNS zone match the load balancer IP.
3. See [Private DNS](../infrastructure/dns.md) for DNS zone deployment.

## GPU and CUDA Errors

### CUDA_ERROR_NO_DEVICE on RTX PRO 6000 nodes

**Cause:** MIG strategy is set to `none` instead of `single`. Azure vGPU hosts enable MIG, and `strategy: none` causes `NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to receive bare GPU UUIDs instead of MIG device UUIDs.

**Resolution:**

Set `mig.strategy: single` in the GPU Operator Helm values for RTX PRO 6000 node pools. See [GPU Configuration](../reference/gpu-configuration.md) for node-specific settings.

> [!WARNING]
> RTX PRO 6000 nodes require `mig.strategy: single`. Using `none` causes all GPU workloads on these nodes to fail with `CUDA_ERROR_NO_DEVICE`.

### GPU Operator attempts to install drivers on GRID driver nodes

**Cause:** Nodes with pre-installed Azure GRID drivers (`580.105.08-grid-azure`) do not need the GPU Operator datacenter driver. Installing both causes conflicts.

**Resolution:**

Label GRID driver nodes with `nvidia.com/gpu.deploy.driver=false` to prevent the GPU Operator from deploying its own driver DaemonSet.

### Vulkan initialization fails in Isaac Sim containers

**Cause:** The `NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES` environment variable is not set to `all`. Isaac Sim requires Vulkan capability for rendering.

**Resolution:**

Set `NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=all` in the job environment variables. This is required for all Isaac Sim workloads regardless of GPU type.

### nvidia-smi shows no GPUs inside the container

**Cause:** The container runtime is not configured with the NVIDIA runtime class, or GPU resource requests are missing from the pod spec.

**Resolution:**

1. Verify the pod spec includes `resources.limits: nvidia.com/gpu: 1`.
2. Confirm the NVIDIA device plugin is running: `kubectl get pods -n gpu-operator`.
3. Check node allocatable GPU count: `kubectl describe node <node> | grep nvidia.com/gpu`.

### Driver version mismatch between host and container

**Cause:** The GPU Operator installed a driver version incompatible with the CUDA toolkit version in the container image.

**Resolution:**

1. Check the host driver version: `nvidia-smi` on the node.
2. Verify compatibility with the [CUDA compatibility matrix](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/).
3. Pin the GPU Operator driver version to match container requirements in the Helm values.

## Deployment Failures

### Terraform provider registration fails

**Cause:** Required Azure resource providers are not registered on the subscription.

**Resolution:**

Run `source infrastructure/terraform/prerequisites/az-sub-init.sh` to register all required providers. The script reads from `infrastructure/terraform/prerequisites/robotics-azure-resource-providers.txt`.

### Terraform plan fails with "subscription not configured"

**Cause:** The `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` environment variable is not set.

**Resolution:**

Run `source infrastructure/terraform/prerequisites/az-sub-init.sh` before any `terraform` commands. This script exports `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` and validates Azure CLI authentication.

### Helm chart installation fails with connection refused

**Cause:** The VPN is not connected, or the deploy scripts are running before the VPN Gateway deployment completes.

**Resolution:**

1. Complete VPN deployment: `infrastructure/terraform/vpn/`.
2. Connect the VPN client.
3. Re-run deploy scripts in order: `01-deploy-robotics-charts.sh` through `03-deploy-osmo.sh`.

### AzureML extension pods stuck in CrashLoopBackOff

**Cause:** Identity or RBAC misconfiguration for the AzureML managed identity, or resource quota exceeded.

**Resolution:**

1. Check pod logs: `kubectl logs <pod> -n azureml`.
2. Verify the managed identity has federated credentials for the `azureml:default` and `azureml:training` service accounts.
3. Check subscription quota: `az vm list-usage --location <region> -o table`.

### OSMO deployment returns oauth2Proxy errors

**Cause:** `oauth2Proxy.enabled` is set to `true` but no OIDC provider is configured.

**Resolution:**

Set `oauth2Proxy.enabled: false` in the OSMO Helm values when no OIDC provider is available. See `infrastructure/setup/03-deploy-osmo.sh` for the configuration.

### Resource group creation fails with quota errors

**Cause:** Subscription-level resource group limit or regional capacity constraints.

**Resolution:**

1. Check current limits: `az account list-locations` and `az vm list-usage --location <region>`.
2. Request quota increases through the Azure portal for the target region.

## Training and Inference Errors

### Isaac Sim job fails with EULA not accepted

**Cause:** The environment variables `ACCEPT_EULA` and `PRIVACY_CONSENT` are not set to `Y`.

**Resolution:**

Add both variables to the job definition:

```yaml
environment_variables:
  ACCEPT_EULA: "Y"
  PRIVACY_CONSENT: "Y"
```

### AzureML model download fails with authentication error

**Cause:** Workload identity auth failure in the `data-capability` sidecar when using `ro_mount` mode.

**Resolution:**

Switch model validation mode from `ro_mount` to `download` in the AzureML job YAML. This is a known workaround for workload identity compatibility.

### numpy ImportError or ABI mismatch in Isaac Sim container

**Cause:** numpy 2.x is installed but Isaac Sim 4.x requires numpy < 2.0.0 for ABI compatibility with its bundled libraries.

**Resolution:**

The `train.sh` script pins numpy to `>=1.26.0,<2.0.0`. Verify this pin is present. If using a custom entrypoint, add:

```bash
uv pip install "numpy>=1.26.0,<2.0.0"
```

### Isaac Sim process hangs after training completes

**Cause:** Isaac Sim 4.x hangs after `env.close()` on vGPU nodes due to a shutdown bug.

**Resolution:**

Use `simulation_shutdown.py` which stops the simulation timeline and applies a SIGKILL watchdog to force process termination.

### Checkpoint upload fails silently

**Cause:** The AzureML named output is wired through `${{outputs.checkpoints}}` in `environment_variables:`, which AzureML does NOT substitute (substitution only happens in `command:`). The container receives the literal template string and the sync helper writes to a relative directory of that name, leaving `cap/data-capability/wd/checkpoints/` empty.

**Resolution:**

1. Read `AZURE_ML_OUTPUT_CHECKPOINTS` (set by the data-capability runtime) directly in the training entry point — do not indirect through a custom env var.
2. Confirm the named `outputs.checkpoints` `uri_folder` is declared in the job YAML.
3. Check job logs (`system_logs/data_capability/data-capability.log`) for `uploaded N files` rather than `is empty. Skip uploading`.

## Workflow Runtime Errors

### OSMO workflow code upload or download fails

**Cause:** The submit host or the workflow pod cannot reach the OSMO object-storage container that carries the packaged code, which the submission uploads with `osmo data upload` and the pod retrieves through a `url:` task input.

**Resolution:**

1. Ensure the submit host is authenticated (`az login`) and holds `Storage Blob Data Contributor` on the OSMO storage account. Set `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME` (and `OSMO_WORKFLOW_BUCKET`, default `osmo`) if they are not resolved from Terraform outputs.
2. Confirm access before submitting: `osmo data check azure://<account>/<container>` returns `{"status": "pass"}`.
3. If the pod fails to fetch the code, verify the workflow pod's workload identity has read access to the same container.

### OSMO code-upload objects accumulate under `osmo-code/`

**Cause:** Each submission content-addresses the packaged code by a hash over its files and uploads it to `osmo-code/<hash>` only when that object is absent. Byte-identical code reuses the existing object, but every distinct code revision creates a new one, so the prefix grows as the code evolves and is not pruned automatically.

**Resolution:**

List the staged archives and delete stale ones, or apply an Azure Storage lifecycle management policy that expires blobs under the prefix:

```bash
osmo data list azure://<account>/<container>/osmo-code
osmo data delete azure://<account>/<container>/osmo-code/<hash>
```

### OSMO workflow YAML template rendering fails

**Cause:** OSMO uses Jinja templates (`{{ }}`). Helm Go template syntax (`{{ .Values }}`) causes parse errors.

**Resolution:**

Convert all template expressions to Jinja syntax. For variable substitution, use `{{ env_var }}` patterns.

### OSMO workflow fails during CreateGroup with Exit Code 3002

**Cause:** OSMO asks Kubernetes to create workflow pods during the CreateGroup phase. Kubernetes calls the KAI Scheduler binder admission webhooks before admitting those pods. If the API server cannot verify the binder webhook TLS certificate, pod admission fails before the training container starts, and OSMO reports `Exit Code: 3002`.

The characteristic Kubernetes error includes `failed calling webhook "binder.run.ai"`, `binder.kai-scheduler.svc`, and an x509 message such as `certificate signed by unknown authority` or `parent certificate cannot sign this kind of certificate`. The `unknown field "spec.env"` warning can appear in the same response but is not the admission blocker.

The KAI Scheduler chart (`v0.5.5`) refreshes `binder-webhook-tls-secret` on every install but does not reliably keep the `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` / `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` `caBundle` in sync with the freshly minted leaf. On upgrade the API server can be left trusting a stale CA while the binder service serves a different leaf. In a degenerate case, `caBundle` references a self-signed cert (`binder.kai-scheduler.svc-ca`) that does not sign the served leaf at all.

A secondary failure mode is binder pods caching an old mounted certificate after a chart upgrade. Tracked as [#794](https://github.com/microsoft/physical-ai-toolchain/issues/794).

**Diagnostics:**

Compare the leaf certificate served by the binder Secret against the `caBundle` advertised on the webhook configs — they must match.

```bash
kubectl -n kai-scheduler get secret binder-webhook-tls-secret \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.tls\.crt}' | base64 --decode |
  openssl x509 -noout -subject -fingerprint -sha256

kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfiguration kai-binder \
  -o jsonpath='{.webhooks[0].clientConfig.caBundle}' | base64 --decode |
  openssl x509 -noout -subject -fingerprint -sha256

kubectl run kai-binder-webhook-tls-check --image=registry.k8s.io/pause:3.10 \
  --restart=Never --dry-run=server -o yaml
```

The dry-run admission probe is the definitive test: it exercises the binder webhook path without creating a pod and surfaces the exact x509 failure the API server sees. If the two fingerprints differ, the cluster is in the drift state described above; the probe will report `x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`.

**Resolution:**

Repair both failure modes manually with the following sequence. Each step is idempotent and safe to re-run on a live cluster.

First, force binder pods to re-read the mounted certificate (sufficient when only the cached cert is stale):

```bash
kubectl -n kai-scheduler rollout restart deployment/binder
kubectl -n kai-scheduler rollout status deployment/binder --timeout=180s
```

Re-run the admission probe above. If the x509 error persists, the Secret and the webhook `caBundle` are out of sync. Sync the `caBundle` on both webhook configs to the leaf certificate currently in the Secret, then restart binder:

```bash
leaf_b64=$(kubectl -n kai-scheduler get secret binder-webhook-tls-secret \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.tls\.crt}')
[[ -n "$leaf_b64" ]] || { echo "binder-webhook-tls-secret has no tls.crt" >&2; exit 1; }

for kind in mutatingwebhookconfiguration validatingwebhookconfiguration; do
  kubectl get "$kind" kai-binder -o json |
    jq --arg ca "$leaf_b64" '.webhooks |= map(.clientConfig.caBundle = $ca)' |
    kubectl replace -f -
done

kubectl -n kai-scheduler rollout restart deployment/binder
kubectl -n kai-scheduler rollout status deployment/binder --timeout=180s
```

If the webhook configs themselves are corrupted (for example, `caBundle` references a self-signed cert that does not match any leaf), delete them and re-run `infrastructure/setup/01-deploy-robotics-charts.sh` to let the chart recreate them. The post-install sync block above then aligns the freshly minted Secret with the recreated configs:

```bash
for kind in mutatingwebhookconfiguration validatingwebhookconfiguration; do
  kubectl delete "$kind" kai-binder --ignore-not-found
done

infrastructure/setup/01-deploy-robotics-charts.sh
```

### KAI scheduler rejects multi-GPU job

**Cause:** Coscheduling (gang-scheduling) requirements are not met. Either insufficient GPU resources or the PodGroup configuration is missing.

**Resolution:**

1. Verify available GPU capacity across nodes: `kubectl describe nodes | grep nvidia.com/gpu`.
2. Confirm the KAI scheduler is installed and configured for coscheduling in the OSMO backend.
3. Reduce GPU request count or wait for node autoscaling to provide capacity.

### OSMO dataset injection fails

**Cause:** The dataset folder name in the workflow YAML does not match the registered dataset name, or the dataset version is not published.

**Resolution:**

1. List available datasets: `osmo dataset list`.
2. Verify the dataset name and version in the workflow environment variables match a published dataset.

### LeRobot training fails with PyTorch shared memory allocation error

**Cause:** PyTorch DataLoader workers use `/dev/shm` to collate batches across worker processes. Kubernetes pods inherit the container runtime default shared-memory mount unless the pod spec overrides it, and that default is too small for image-heavy LeRobot batches. The failure occurs after OSMO creates the pod and after training starts, so it is not an OSMO `CreateGroup`, KAI, or webhook TLS issue.

Characteristic log line:

```text
RuntimeError: unable to allocate shared memory(shm) for file </torch_...>: Success (0)
```

**Resolution:**

OSMO mounts `/dev/shm` according to the pod template in Helm values, with `USER_SHM_SIZE` rendered from the platform config (default `16Gi` for GPU platforms). The mount applies only to pods created *after* the config is deployed — restarting the training pod is not enough; a stuck workflow must be cancelled and resubmitted.

In ConfigMap mode the pod template — including `USER_SHM_SIZE` — is the source of truth in `infrastructure/setup/values/osmo-platforms.yaml` and is rendered into the deployed ConfigMap on every run of the deploy script. Inspect the live pod to verify it received the mount, and check the values file for the size it should have:

```bash
# Live pod (the actual verification)
kubectl get pod <pod> -n osmo-workflows -o jsonpath='{.spec.volumes[?(@.name=="dshm")].emptyDir.sizeLimit}'
kubectl get pod <pod> -n osmo-workflows -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[?(@.name!="osmo-ctrl")].volumeMounts[?(@.mountPath=="/dev/shm")].name}'

# Expected size in the source values (for comparison)
grep -A 3 dshm infrastructure/setup/values/osmo-platforms.yaml
```

If a running pod lacks the `dshm` mount, either the values file was edited without rerunning `infrastructure/setup/03-deploy-osmo.sh` (rerun it to re-render the ConfigMap), or the pod predates the last config update — cancel the workflow and submit a new one so it picks up the current template.

If new pods still exhaust `/dev/shm`, raise `USER_SHM_SIZE` in `infrastructure/setup/values/osmo-platforms.yaml` (current default is `16Gi` for GPU platforms), rerun `03-deploy-osmo.sh`, and resubmit. Reducing `--batch-size` is the workaround when raising the mount is not an option.

### OSMO workflow pods stuck in Pending

**Cause:** The `osmo-workflows` namespace lacks resource quota or node affinity rules prevent scheduling.

**Resolution:**

1. Check pod events: `kubectl describe pod <pod> -n osmo-workflows`.
2. Verify node taints and tolerations match the pod spec.
3. Check namespace resource quotas: `kubectl get resourcequota -n osmo-workflows`.

### OSMO workflow completes task but workflow status stays RUNNING or fails

**Cause:** The `service_base_url` field in the OSMO `SERVICE` config is empty or points to a service that does not route `/api/logger` paths. The osmo-ctrl sidecar in workflow pods uses this URL to connect via WebSocket to the logger service and to refresh auth tokens. When misconfigured, the sidecar logs `websocket: bad handshake` or connection refused errors, preventing the workflow from reporting completion.

**Resolution:**

1. Inspect the osmo-ctrl sidecar arguments on a workflow pod:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pod <pod> -n osmo-workflows -o json | \
     python3 -c "import sys,json; [print(a) for c in json.load(sys.stdin)['spec']['containers'] if c['name']=='osmo-ctrl' for a in c.get('args',[])]"
   ```

2. If `-host` is empty (`""`), `service_base_url` in the SERVICE config is not set. In ConfigMap mode this value is rendered from the Helm values:

   ```bash
   grep service_base_url infrastructure/setup/values/osmo-control-plane.yaml
   ```

3. Set `service_base_url` to the AzureML ingress controller ClusterIP FQDN by editing `infrastructure/setup/values/osmo-control-plane.yaml` (`services.configs.service.service_base_url`) and rerunning the deploy script:

   ```yaml
   # infrastructure/setup/values/osmo-control-plane.yaml
   services:
     configs:
       service:
         service_base_url: "http://azureml-ingress-nginx-controller.azureml.svc.cluster.local"
   ```

   ```bash
   ./infrastructure/setup/03-deploy-osmo.sh
   ```

4. Cancel and resubmit the workflow. New pods pick up the updated `service_base_url`.

> [!NOTE]
> `service_base_url` points to `osmo-gateway`, which routes `/api/logger`, `/api/agent`, `/api/auth`, and related paths to the correct backend services.

### OSMO UI shows "server IP address could not be found" for workflow logs

**Cause:** The `service_base_url` is set to an in-cluster FQDN (e.g., `azureml-ingress-nginx-controller.azureml.svc.cluster.local`) that the browser cannot resolve. The OSMO UI constructs workflow overview URLs from this value.

**Resolution:**

Connect via VPN and set `service_base_url` to the internal load balancer IP, which is reachable from both in-cluster pods and the VPN-connected browser:

```bash
# Find the internal LB IP
kubectl get svc azureml-ingress-nginx-internal-lb -n azureml \
  -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'
```

Set that IP as `services.configs.service.service_base_url` in `infrastructure/setup/values/osmo-control-plane.yaml`, then rerun the deploy script:

```yaml
# infrastructure/setup/values/osmo-control-plane.yaml
services:
  configs:
    service:
      service_base_url: "http://10.0.5.6"  # replace with actual internal LB IP
```

```bash
./infrastructure/setup/03-deploy-osmo.sh
```

Without VPN, use the CLI to view workflow logs: `osmo workflow logs <workflow-id>`.
