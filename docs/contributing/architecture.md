## Current and Past Architecture

This repository provides Azure-integrated infrastructure and tooling for NVIDIA Isaac Lab-based robotics training, inference, and orchestration through NVIDIA OSMO and Azure Machine Learning.

### Repository Structure

| Directory    | Purpose                                                                                                       |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `deploy/`    | Ordered Terraform IaC and shell scripts for Azure infrastructure provisioning and Kubernetes cluster setup.   |
| `src/`       | Python code for training and inference, acting as a shim between NVIDIA OSS libraries and Azure services.     |
| `workflows/` | OSMO workflow and AzureML job YAML definitions for training, inference, and validation.                       |
| `scripts/`   | Convenience scripts for submitting OSMO workflows and AzureML jobs, plus CI linting and security tooling.     |
| `external/`  | Cloned NVIDIA Isaac Lab repository for local development intellisense and reference.                          |
| `docs/`      | Documentation covering GPU configuration, MLflow integration, deployment validation, and contributing guides. |

### Source Code Organization

The `src/` directory contains three packages:

| Package      | Contents                                                                                                |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `common/`    | Shared CLI argument parsing utilities                                                                   |
| `training/`  | Isaac Lab training scripts with skrl, RSL-RL, and LeRobot integration plus Azure MLflow metric tracking |
| `inference/` | Policy export, playback, and inference node scripts                                                     |

Training scripts and Python code act as integration shims between NVIDIA's open-source repositories and Azure connectivity features: MLflow from AzureML for tracking training metrics, logs, and checkpoints; the AzureML model registry for checkpoint versioning; and Azure Blob Storage for dataset access.

### Python Dependencies

The root `pyproject.toml` serves local development dependency management:

| Context           | Usage                                                           |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Local development | Providing module availability for intellisense and verification |

This setup is not intended for building publishable Python packages. The `pyproject.toml` build target only packages `training/rl` into a wheel for in-container use.

## Future and Ongoing Architecture

This codebase will reorganize around eight lifecycle domains for robotics and physical AI, each built on current Azure services and NVIDIA's Physical AI Stack. Each domain represents a distinct functional concern in the physical AI lifecycle.

### Domain Overview

Each domain maps to a root-level directory in this repository. Domains that require Azure infrastructure beyond what `infrastructure/` provides maintain their own IaC subdirectories.

| Domain             | Directory             | Scope                                                                       |
|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Infrastructure     | `infrastructure/`     | Shared Azure services: AKS, AzureML, networking, storage, observability     |
| Data Pipeline      | `data-pipeline/`      | Robot-to-cloud data capture via Azure Arc and ROS 2 episodic recording      |
| Data Management    | `data-management/`    | Episodic data viewer, labeling, dataset curation, and job orchestration     |
| Synthetic Data     | `synthetic-data/`     | SDG pipelines leveraging NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation models              |
| Training           | `training/`           | Policy training, packaging to TensorRT/ONNX, and model registration         |
| Evaluation         | `evaluation/`         | Software-in-the-loop and hardware-in-the-loop validation pipelines          |
| Fleet Deployment   | `fleet-deployment/`   | Edge deployment via FluxCD GitOps on Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes           |
| Fleet Intelligence | `fleet-intelligence/` | Production telemetry, on-robot policy analytics, and fleet health reporting |

### Infrastructure

Shared Azure services required across all domains. Terraform modules provision AKS clusters with GPU node pools, AzureML workspaces, Azure Container Registry, Key Vault, managed identities, networking (VNet, subnets, NAT Gateway), and observability (Azure Monitor, DCGM metrics). Domain-specific infrastructure that stands alone (VPN, automation, DNS) deploys from subdirectories within each domain rather than the shared module.

### Data Pipeline

Tooling and infrastructure for capturing real-world robot data and transmitting it to Azure. This domain covers:

- Setup scripts for deploying Azure Arc, Arc-enabled Kubernetes, and data transfer components to edge devices
- Azure Arc and Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes configuration on edge devices co-located with robots
- ROS 2 episodic data capture scripts for imitation learning (IL) training datasets
- Data transfer orchestration from edge storage to Azure Blob Storage
- Example programs demonstrating episodic recording from physical robot hardware

Episodic data follows the [LeRobot dataset format](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot) to maintain compatibility with the broader robotics ML ecosystem.

### Data Management

An episodic data viewer and curator built on top of LeRobot's visualization tooling. The viewer runs locally for development and can optionally be deployed to an Azure-hosted web app through the included setup scripts. Capabilities include:

- Browsing, labeling, and categorizing episodic datasets across Blob Storage containers
- Assigning datasets to training workflows and triggering OSMO or AzureML jobs directly from the viewer
- Evaluating synthetic data generation outputs for quality and diversity
- Reviewing playback video captured during policy evaluation runs
- Curating datasets by filtering, splitting, and merging episode collections

### Synthetic Data

Pipelines for synthetic data generation (SDG) through OSMO workflows and AzureML jobs. This domain will incorporate NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation models for generating photorealistic training data:

- [Cosmos-Transfer](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-transfer2.5) for converting simulated environments into photorealistic video, bridging the sim-to-real gap for policy training
- [Cosmos-Predict](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-predict2.5) for generating novel future frames from initial conditions, expanding dataset diversity
- [Cosmos-Reason](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-reason2) for data curation through physical common-sense reasoning against video clips
- Full example SDG workflows that chain Isaac Sim scene generation with Cosmos Transfer post-processing

The [Cosmos Cookbook](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-cookbook) provides post-training scripts and recipes that this domain's workflows will reference for model customization.

### Training

End-to-end training pipeline from raw data to packaged, deployable model artifacts. Training code is organized by learning approach, with each approach containing its own source, workflows, and configuration:

| Approach | Directory       | Scope                                                               |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| RL       | `training/rl/`  | Reinforcement learning with Isaac Lab (skrl, RSL-RL)                |
| IL       | `training/il/`  | Imitation learning with LeRobot and demonstration datasets          |
| VLA      | `training/vla/` | Vision-language-action model training for generalist robot policies |

Cross-cutting concerns shared across approaches:

- Multi-GPU and multi-node training orchestration through OSMO workflows and AzureML jobs
- Policy export and packaging into TensorRT and ONNX formats for edge inference
- Container image creation with packaged policies, versioned and pushed to the AzureML model registry
- Model distribution through [Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/) for centralized model management and deployment
- Setup scripts for deploying training pipelines to OSMO and AzureML compute targets
- Full end-to-end pipelines that chain training, export, packaging, and registration into a single orchestrated workflow

A complete example pipeline demonstrates the full path from trained checkpoint to containerized inference image registered in AzureML.

### Evaluation

Software-in-the-loop (SiL) and hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) evaluation pipelines for trained policies. Both approaches use Isaac Sim to emulate the target robot, with the trained policy controlling the simulation.

| Approach | Infrastructure                                                                                         | Policy Host                     |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| SiL      | Any available compute that can serve the policy as an inference endpoint                               | AzureML managed endpoint or AKS |
| HiL      | Target deployment hardware (typically NVIDIA Jetson) running the containerized TensorRT or ONNX policy | Edge device matching production |

Evaluation metrics capture to:

- AzureML experiment tracking for per-episode performance metrics
- Azure Monitor for operational dashboards and Grafana visualization
- Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence for streaming telemetry analysis

Setup scripts deploy evaluation pipelines to OSMO and AzureML compute targets. Full end-to-end evaluation pipelines orchestrate policy loading, simulation execution, metric collection, and result publishing as a single workflow.

Isaac Sim connects to the deployed policy endpoint, generating control signals and receiving observations to produce evaluation episodes that the Data Management domain can review.

### Fleet Deployment

Edge deployment of packaged policy containers to robots through GitOps. This domain includes:

- [FluxCD](https://fluxcd.io/) GitOps manifests for [Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/overview) clusters co-located with robots
- Bootstrap scripts for configuring FluxCD on Arc-connected clusters
- A hot-loading workflow deployed alongside the GitOps configuration that pulls new policy container images and stages them for deployment
- A gating service (running on or near the robot) that explicitly approves staged policies before deployment, with configurable deployment windows

The deployment flow: AzureML model registry publishes a new container image, FluxCD detects the manifest update, the hot-loader pulls and stages the image on the Arc cluster, and the gating service approves deployment to the robot on the operator's schedule.

### Fleet Intelligence

Production monitoring, robotics telemetry, and on-robot policy performance analytics that close the data flywheel. The deployment lifecycle does not end when a policy reaches a robot. This domain captures what happens after deployment and feeds insights back into Data Pipeline and Training.

Capabilities include:

- On-robot policy performance tracking: success/failure rates per episode, grasp accuracy, navigation completion rates, and task-specific KPIs streamed from deployed robots
- Robotics telemetry ingestion into [Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/) for streaming analytics across robot fleets
- Fleet-wide health dashboards via [Azure Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/) and Grafana showing policy version distribution, error rates, latency percentiles, and hardware utilization
- Policy drift detection: automated comparison of production performance against evaluation baselines, triggering alerts when degradation exceeds thresholds
- Integration with [Azure IoT Operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/iot-operations/) for edge telemetry aggregation, device management, and secure data routing from robots to Azure
- Automated retraining triggers that connect fleet telemetry back to the Data Pipeline domain, closing the feedback loop from production observations to new training data
- Setup scripts for deploying Azure IoT Operations to Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters, configuring telemetry pipelines, and provisioning dashboards and alerting rules

This domain distinguishes itself from Evaluation (which validates policies in simulation before deployment) by focusing on real-world, production-time signals from physical robots operating in uncontrolled environments.

### Simulation Guidance

Simulation environment authoring, including robot asset import (USD, URDF, MJCF), scene configuration, domain randomization, and Isaac Lab task design, is a prerequisite for training and evaluation. NVIDIA provides comprehensive tooling and documentation for these workflows through [Isaac Sim](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/latest/index.html) and the [Isaac Lab Reference Architecture](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/refs/reference_architecture/index.html).

This repository will not maintain a separate codebase domain for simulation. Instead, the `docs/` directory will provide guidance on:

- Setting up Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab environments for use with this reference architecture
- Importing custom robot assets and configuring scenes for training tasks
- Applying domain randomization to improve sim-to-real policy transfer
- Designing Isaac Lab environments using Manager-based and Direct workflows
- Connecting simulation outputs to the Synthetic Data and Training domains

## Agentic Tooling

This project uses [GitHub Copilot](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview) agents, instructions, prompts, and skills to automate development workflows. Tooling comes from two sources: the HVE-Core extension (shared across Microsoft HVE projects) and project-specific artifacts defined in `.github/`.

### HVE-Core Extension

The [hve-core-all](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ise-hve-essentials.hve-core-all) VS Code extension provides shared agentic tooling:

| Artifact Type | Count | Examples                                                                         |
|---------------|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Agents        | 33    | RPI workflow, backlog management, PR creation                                    |
| Instructions  | 24    | Coding standards (Bash, C#, Python, Terraform, Bicep), commit messages, markdown |
| Prompts       | 27    | ADO work items, GitHub issues, security planning, PR descriptions                |
| Skills        | 2     | PR reference generation, video-to-GIF conversion                                 |

HVE-Core artifacts are registered via the extension's `package.json` `contributes` section and loaded when the extension activates.

### Project Copilot Artifacts

This repository defines project-specific artifacts in `.github/` that extend HVE-Core with domain knowledge:

| Artifact Type | Count | Purpose                                                                          |
|---------------|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Agents        | 2     | OSMO training manager, dataviewer developer                                      |
| Instructions  | 4     | Copilot instructions, dataviewer conventions, documentation style, shell scripts |
| Prompts       | 4     | OSMO training submission, LeRobot pipeline, dataviewer workflows                 |
| Skills        | 2     | Dataviewer interaction, OSMO LeRobot training                                    |

Project artifacts are auto-discovered by VS Code from the `.github/` directory without explicit registration.

Two workflow chains compose these artifacts:

- **OSMO Training Manager**: `osmo-training-manager` agent → `osmo-lerobot-training` skill → training submission prompts
- **Dataviewer Developer**: `dataviewer-developer` agent → `dataviewer` skill → dataviewer instruction conventions

### Artifact Types and Loading

Each artifact type uses YAML frontmatter to declare behavior:

| Artifact     | File Pattern        | Key Frontmatter                | Loading                                      |
|--------------|---------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Agents       | `*.agent.md`        | `mode`, `tools`, `description` | Auto-discovered from `.github/agents/`       |
| Instructions | `*.instructions.md` | `applyTo`, `description`       | Auto-discovered from `.github/instructions/` |
| Prompts      | `*.prompt.md`       | `mode`, `description`, `tools` | Auto-discovered from `.github/prompts/`      |
| Skills       | `SKILL.md`          | N/A (referenced by agents)     | Referenced via `copilot-skill:` URI          |

HVE-Core artifacts follow the same patterns but load through extension contribution points rather than workspace auto-discovery.

For the detailed per-artifact inventory and workflow chain diagrams, see [Copilot Artifacts](../reference/copilot-artifacts.md).

## Agent Skills and Specification Documents

Each domain will contain specification documents alongside working examples. These specifications serve as structured inputs for [GitHub Copilot Agent Skills](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode), enabling customers to adapt this reference architecture to their own codebase and infrastructure.

### Specification Structure

Every domain directory will include:

| Artifact                            | Purpose                                                                                    |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `README.md`                         | Domain overview, quick start, and usage guide                                              |
| `examples/`                         | Complete, runnable examples with code, scripts, and configurations                         |
| `specifications/`                   | Domain specifications describing capabilities, inputs, outputs, and contracts              |
| `specifications/*.specification.md` | Individual specifications that Agent Skills consume to generate customized implementations |
| `.github/skills/`                   | Agent Skill definitions referencing the domain's specifications                            |

Domain documentation lives under the root `docs/` directory rather than inside each domain folder. Each domain has a corresponding subdirectory at `docs/<domain>/` containing detailed guidance, architecture decisions, and tutorials.

### How Agent Skills Use Specifications

Specifications define the contracts and patterns for each domain so that Agent Skills can generate customized implementations:

1. A customer identifies which domains apply to their robotics use case.
2. Agent Skills read the domain specifications to understand available capabilities, required Azure resources, integration points, and configuration options.
3. The customer describes their specific requirements (robot platform, sensor configuration, training framework preferences, deployment topology).
4. Agent Skills generate tailored infrastructure, code, and configuration files that integrate with the customer's existing codebase while following the patterns proven in this reference architecture.

Each customer may have different hardware configurations, Azure subscription topologies, network constraints, and compliance requirements. Specifications capture the variability points so Agent Skills can produce implementations that fit, rather than requiring manual adaptation of generic examples.

### Example Specification Content

A training domain specification might define:

- Supported RL frameworks and their configuration schemas
- Required Azure resources (AzureML workspace, compute targets, storage accounts)
- Container image build patterns for different GPU architectures
- MLflow experiment tracking integration contracts
- Policy export format requirements (TensorRT version, ONNX opset)
- OSMO workflow template parameters and their valid ranges
