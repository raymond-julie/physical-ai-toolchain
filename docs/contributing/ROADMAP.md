This roadmap covers planned work for the Physical AI Toolchain through Q1 2027.
Six priority areas align to milestones v0.2.0 through v0.7.0, progressing from documentation through security hardening.
An additional v0.8.0 milestone covers dependency update automation.
The Architecture Domain Rollout priority phases the repository reorganization around eight lifecycle domains defined in the [Future and Ongoing Architecture](architecture.md#future-and-ongoing-architecture).
Each area lists concrete deliverables with linked issues and explicit items we will not pursue.

## Current State

The project reached v0.1.0 on 2026-02-07 with 30 commits on main and 24 merged pull requests.
Seven milestones are planned through v0.8.0, spanning foundation work through security hardening.
OpenSSF Best Practices Passing criteria are approximately 85% met (43 Met, 7 Partial, 12 Gap, 6 N/A).

### Architecture Domain Rollout (Q2 2026 – Q3 2026)

All future enhancements, features, and functionality align to the eight lifecycle domains defined in the [Future and Ongoing Architecture](architecture.md#future-and-ongoing-architecture). Each domain represents a distinct functional concern in the physical AI lifecycle, from data capture through fleet-scale production monitoring. New work items target a specific domain and follow the patterns, specifications, and directory structure established in the architecture.

Domains roll out in three phases based on dependency order and infrastructure readiness:

| Phase | Timeline | Domains                                        |
|-------|----------|------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Q2 2026  | Infrastructure, Training, Evaluation           |
| 2     | Q2 2026  | Data Pipeline, Data Management, Synthetic Data |
| 3     | Q3 2026  | Fleet Deployment, Fleet Intelligence           |

Phase 1 migrates existing `deploy/` and `src/` content into the Infrastructure and Training domains, then establishes the Evaluation domain for SiL and HiL validation pipelines. Phase 2 introduces data capture from physical robots, episodic data curation, and synthetic data generation using NVIDIA Cosmos. Phase 3 adds edge deployment through FluxCD GitOps and production telemetry through Azure IoT Operations and Fabric Real-Time Intelligence.

**Will Do:**

* ~~Migrate existing Terraform IaC from `deploy/001-iac/` into `infrastructure/terraform/`~~ (complete)
* ~~Migrate existing setup scripts from `deploy/002-setup/` into `infrastructure/setup/`~~ (complete)
* ~~Reorganize `src/training/` and `src/inference/` into `training/rl/`, `training/il/`, and `training/vla/`~~ (complete)
* Establish `evaluation/sil/` and `evaluation/hil/` with Isaac Sim-based evaluation pipelines
* Create `data-pipeline/` with Azure Arc edge agent setup and ROS 2 episodic capture
* Create `data-management/` with LeRobot-based episodic data viewer and curation tooling
* Create `synthetic-data/` with NVIDIA Cosmos Transfer, Predict, and Reason integration
* Create `fleet-deployment/` with FluxCD GitOps manifests and policy gating service
* Create `fleet-intelligence/` with Azure IoT Operations telemetry and Fabric RTI dashboards
* Add Agent Skill specification documents (`specifications/`) in each domain directory
* Add simulation guidance documentation under `docs/simulation/`

**Won't Do:**

* Maintain a separate simulation code domain (NVIDIA provides comprehensive OSS tooling)
* Build custom robot hardware drivers or firmware
* Implement production SLA monitoring beyond reference dashboard examples

## Out of Scope

* Production SLA or uptime guarantees
* Multi-cloud support
* Custom robot hardware integration guides
* Paid support tiers or enterprise licensing
* Backward compatibility guarantees for infrastructure modules
* Automated deployment pipelines for end users

## Success Metrics

| Metric                       | Current | Q2 2026 Target | Q4 2026 Target |

| Test coverage (Python)       | 0%      | 60%            | 80%            |
| CI workflow count            | 4       | 8              | 10             |
| Contributing guide count     | 7       | 8              | 9              |
| Average PR review time       | N/A     | < 3 days       | < 2 days       |
