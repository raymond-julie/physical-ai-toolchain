## Reporting Bugs

### Before Submitting a Bug Report

Before creating a bug report:

* Search [existing issues](https://github.com/microsoft/physical-ai-toolchain/issues) for similar deployment errors or problems
* Verify you are using tested versions: Terraform >= 1.9.8, Azure CLI >= 2.65.0
* Check Azure resource quotas and limits: `az vm list-usage --location <region>`
* Confirm network mode (private/hybrid/public) matches documented requirements
* Test with minimal configuration first (public network mode before private, single GPU node before multi-node)

### How to Submit a Bug Report

Create a [new issue](https://github.com/microsoft/physical-ai-toolchain/issues/new) with:

**Title:** \[Terraform\]\[SIL Module\] AKS cluster creation fails with subnet authorization error

**Environment:**

* Region: eastus2
* Network mode: private
* Terraform: 1.9.8
* Azure CLI: 2.65.0
* VM SKU: Standard_NC24ads_A100_v4

**Expected Behavior:**

`terraform apply` creates AKS cluster with GPU node pool using private network configuration.

**Actual Behavior:**

Deployment fails during AKS cluster creation with authorization error:

```text
Error: creating Managed Kubernetes Cluster: Code="LinkedAuthorizationFailed"
Message="The client has permission to perform action 'Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/write'
on scope '/subscriptions/.../resourceGroups/.../providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/aks-cluster';
however, it does not have permission to perform action 'Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action'
on the linked scope(s) '/subscriptions/.../resourceGroups/.../providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/vnet/subnets/aks-subnet'"
```

**Resource State:**

```bash
az resource show --ids /subscriptions/.../resourceGroups/.../providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/vnet/subnets/aks-subnet
```

Output shows subnet exists but lacks role assignment for AKS managed identity.

**Reproduction Steps:**

1. Set up `terraform.tfvars` with private network mode
2. Run `terraform init && terraform plan`
3. Run `terraform apply`
4. Observe failure at AKS cluster creation step

**Configuration:**

```hcl
network_mode = "private"
enable_private_cluster = true
aks_subnet_cidr = "10.0.2.0/24"
```

**Cost Impact:**

Reproduced the issue with prerequisite resources (VNet, Key Vault, Storage Account) deployed before AKS creation step failed. Incurred ~$0.10/hour while debugging. Destroyed all resources after confirming the issue.

**Additional Context:**

Deployment script creates VNet and subnet but appears to skip role assignment for AKS managed identity on subnet. Manually assigning `Network Contributor` role on subnet allows deployment to succeed.

After submission, expect initial acknowledgment within the timeframes documented in [SUPPORT.md](https://github.com/microsoft/physical-ai-toolchain/blob/main/SUPPORT.md).

## Suggesting Enhancements

### Before Submitting an Enhancement

Before suggesting an enhancement:

* Determine if the enhancement is broadly applicable (blueprint improvement) or organization-specific (belongs in a fork)
* Search [existing issues](https://github.com/microsoft/physical-ai-toolchain/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/microsoft/physical-ai-toolchain/pulls) for similar proposals
* Consider cost implications if adding new Azure services or increasing resource scale
* Verify compatibility with all three network modes (private/hybrid/public) or document known limitations
* Check if enhancement aligns with reference architecture goals (generalized deployment patterns vs. specific use cases)

### How to Submit an Enhancement

Create a [new issue](https://github.com/microsoft/physical-ai-toolchain/issues/new) with:

* Clear title describing the enhancement
* Problem statement: What limitation or gap does this enhancement address?
* Proposed solution: Describe the technical approach
* Azure services: List new services required, with cost implications
* Breaking changes: Indicate if existing deployments require migration
* Contributor personas: Which personas benefit most (ML engineers, infrastructure engineers, DevOps/SRE, robotics developers)?
* Network mode compatibility: Specify if enhancement works in all modes or has limitations
* Alternatives considered: Other approaches evaluated and why this solution is preferred
* Reference architecture precedent: Similar patterns in other Azure reference architectures or Microsoft guidance

## Your First Code Contribution

This reference architecture validates through deployment rather than automated tests. The validation level depends on your contribution type.

### PR Workflow

1. **Check the issue is open and unassigned.** Comment on the issue to request assignment before starting any work. Maintainers will assign you when confirmed.
   * If the issue is already assigned to someone, do not open a competing PR without first coordinating with the assignee or a maintainer.
   * Issues labelled `needs-triage` are not ready to be picked up. You are welcome to comment your interest in being assigned — maintainers will follow up once triage is complete.
2. Fork the repository to your GitHub account
3. Create a branch from `main` with descriptive name: `feature/private-endpoint-support` or `fix/gpu-scheduling-timeout`
4. Make changes following style guides and conventions
5. Open a draft PR early for maintainer feedback
6. Perform validation appropriate to your contribution type (see table below)
7. Mark PR ready for review after completing validation
8. Address review feedback promptly
9. Merge occurs after approval and passing maintainer integration tests

### Testing Documentation

In your PR description, document:

* Validation performed: Commands run, deployments tested
* Environment used: Dev subscription, network mode, Azure region
* Cost incurred: Estimate for resources deployed during testing
* Known limitations: Untested scenarios or edge cases

Maintainers perform integration testing across multiple scenarios before merge. Contributors are not expected to test all permutations (different regions, network modes, SKU variations).

## Improving The Documentation

Documentation contributions improve the architecture for the entire robotics and AI community.

### High-Value Documentation Contributions

* Deployment troubleshooting guides: Expand [azureml-validation-job-debugging.md](../evaluation/azureml-validation-job-debugging.md) with new scenarios
* Region/SKU compatibility matrices: Document tested combinations and known limitations
* Cost optimization strategies: Real-world cost profiles and reduction techniques
* Network architecture decisions: Guidance on when to use private vs. hybrid vs. public modes
* Migration guides: Instructions for handling breaking changes or infrastructure updates
* Architecture decision records (ADRs): Document major design choices and trade-offs

### Documentation Validation

Before submitting documentation changes:

* Run `npm run lint:md` to check formatting and style
* Verify internal links with `npm run lint:links`
* Test code samples in deployment environment
* Review against [docs-style-and-conventions.instructions.md](https://github.com/microsoft/physical-ai-toolchain/blob/main/.github/instructions/docs-style-and-conventions.instructions.md)
