> [!NOTE]
> This guide expands on the [Deployment Validation](README.md#-deployment-validation) section of the main contributing guide.

This reference architecture validates through deployment rather than automated unit or integration tests. Validation approach depends on contribution scope and cost constraints.

## Validation Levels

### Level 1: Static Validation

Required for all contributions before submitting PR.

**Commands:**

```bash
# Terraform formatting and validation
npm run lint:tf:validate

# Shell script linting
shellcheck infrastructure/**/*.sh scripts/**/*.sh

# Documentation validation
npm install
npm run lint:md
```

**When to use:** Every contribution (documentation, code, infrastructure).

**Cost:** $0

### Level 2: Plan Validation

Required for Terraform module or configuration changes.

**Commands:**

```bash
cd infrastructure/terraform
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
# Edit terraform.tfvars with your subscription details

terraform init
terraform plan -var-file=terraform.tfvars -out=tfplan
terraform show tfplan
```

**Documentation required in PR:**

* Resource changes: X resources to add, Y to change, Z to destroy
* Verification: no unexpected deletions or replacements
* Attach plan output (redact sensitive information)

**When to use:** Terraform changes (modules, variables, resources).

**Cost:** $0 (plan only, no deployment)

### Level 3: Deployment Testing

Optional for most PRs due to cost (~$25-50 for 8-hour session). Required for significant infrastructure changes.

**Minimal test deployment:**

```bash
# Use public network mode for faster/simpler testing
cd infrastructure/terraform
terraform apply -var-file=terraform.tfvars -var="network_mode=public"

# Test specific functionality
az aks get-credentials --resource-group <rg> --name <aks-name>
kubectl get nodes  # Verify GPU nodes
helm list -A  # Verify Helm chart deployments

# Destroy promptly
terraform destroy -var-file=terraform.tfvars
```

**Documentation required in PR:**

* What was tested: deployment components and validation steps
* What was not tested: scenarios deferred to maintainer validation
* Cost incurred: estimated total cost for testing session

**Example:**

> Deployed full infrastructure in eastus with public network mode. Verified GPU node pool created with 1 Standard_NC24ads_A100_v4 node. Confirmed GPU Operator and OSMO backend deployed successfully. Did not test private network mode. Cost: ~$30 for 6-hour deployment test.

**When to use:** Major infrastructure changes, new modules, network architecture changes.

**Cost:** $25-50 (8-hour session with GPU VMs and managed services)

### Level 4: Workflow Validation

Required for changes to training scripts, workflow templates, or AzureML integration.

**Commands:**

```bash
# AzureML training job
./scripts/submit-azureml-training.sh

# OSMO workflow
./scripts/submit-osmo-training.sh
```

**Documentation required in PR:**

* Job completion status: success or failure
* Training duration: total runtime
* Logs excerpt: key outputs demonstrating expected behavior
* Cost: GPU VM time and storage costs

**When to use:** Training scripts, workflow templates, AzureML/OSMO integration changes.

**Cost:** Variable (depends on training duration and GPU SKU)

## Testing Documentation Template

Copy this template to PR description:

```markdown
## Validation Performed

**Static Validation:**
- [ ] npm run lint:tf:validate
- [ ] shellcheck (if applicable)
- [ ] npm run lint:md (if docs changed)

**Plan Validation (Terraform changes):**
- [ ] terraform plan executed
- [ ] Plan output attached (see below)
- [ ] Expected changes: X to add, Y to change, Z to destroy
- [ ] No unexpected resource replacements

**Deployment Testing:**
- [ ] Deployed in dev subscription: (subscription ID or description)
- [ ] Region: (e.g., eastus)
- [ ] Network mode: public | hybrid | private
- [ ] Tested components: (list components validated)
- [ ] Cost incurred: (estimated cost)
- [ ] Resources destroyed: Yes | No

**Workflow Testing:**
- [ ] Training job submitted: azureml | osmo
- [ ] Job status: success | failed
- [ ] Duration: (e.g., 45 minutes)
- [ ] Logs: (attach or link to logs)

## Untested Scenarios

Document scenarios not validated:
- (e.g., Private network mode - maintainer will validate)
- (e.g., Multi-GPU training - tested single GPU only)
- (e.g., Production-scale node pools - tested 1 node)
```

## Cost Optimization

Strategies for minimizing testing costs while maintaining validation quality.

### Cost by Validation Level

| Validation Level             | Typical Cost | Duration         |
|------------------------------|--------------|------------------|
| Static validation            | $0           | 5-10 minutes     |
| Plan validation              | $0           | 5-15 minutes     |
| Deployment testing (minimal) | $10-25       | 2-4 hours        |
| Deployment testing (full)    | $25-50       | 6-8 hours        |
| Workflow validation          | $5-30        | 30 min - 2 hours |

### Cost Control Strategies

**Use smaller deployments:**

```bash
# Single GPU node instead of default pool size
terraform apply -var="gpu_node_count=1"

# Public network mode (simpler, faster)
terraform apply -var="network_mode=public"
```

**Set spending alerts:**

```bash
# Create budget for testing
az consumption budget create \
  --budget-name "PR-Testing" \
  --amount 100 \
  --time-grain Monthly \
  --resource-group <rg>
```

**Monitor costs:**

```bash
# Check recent usage
az consumption usage list \
  --start-date $(date -d '1 day ago' +%Y-%m-%d) \
  --output table
```

**Immediate cleanup:**

```bash
# Destroy all resources after validation
terraform destroy -auto-approve -var-file=terraform.tfvars

# Verify resource deletion
az resource list --resource-group <rg> --output table
```

### Regional Pricing Considerations

GPU VM costs vary by region. Use [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/) to estimate costs for your target region.

| Region      | Standard_NC24ads_A100_v4 Hourly Cost |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| East US     | ~$3.06/hour                          |
| West US 2   | ~$3.06/hour                          |
| West Europe | ~$3.67/hour                          |

> [!TIP]
> Test in regions with lower GPU costs when region-specific features are not being validated.
